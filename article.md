* The Statistics of Championship Droughts

The Boston Red Sox went 86 years without a World Series. The Chicago Cubs went over a century. Even today, there are teams with preposterously long championship droughts.

I got curious: what is the probability of such a drought? This question turned out to be more interesting than I expected!

A few assumptions to simplify things: let's assume that a champion is picked randomly from the set of teams playing each year. This is a wild oversimplification, but, whatever. The second assumption is that I'm just going to assume that the same X teams have been in the league for the same amount of time. This isn't true either -- leagues grow and shrink, teams change -- but it simplifies the math as well. 

Okay, so on to the statistics.
